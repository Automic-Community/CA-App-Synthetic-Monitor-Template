Documenation and Instructions
---

<p><a href="https://asm.ca.com/">CA App Synthetic Monitor</a> (CA ASM) monitors internet facing applications. With CA App Synthetic Monitor, you monitor your applications from the end-users perspective and from several locations around the globe.</p>
<p>During the release of a new application version it may be expected that application response times are a little longer than in normal operating conditions. You hence do not want the monitoring product and team to create incidents when you are rolling-out an upgrade. With this Action Pack, you can have your application upgrade automated procedure to automatically stop the monitoring of the application, and start it again once done with the upgrade.</p>
<p>This Template works together with the Action Pack for CA Application Performance Management, to accelerate the troubleshooting of potential performance degradations after the upgrade.</p>
